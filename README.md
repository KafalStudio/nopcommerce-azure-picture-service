# nopcommerce-azure-picture-service
Azure Blob based picture service for nopCommerce. 
Default picture service of nopCommerce uses database to store binary images which is not scalable in case application becomes too large. SQL Azure is a also expensive to use hence the need of this feature. 
Created it as a plugin so that it could be deployed easily.
